function g_PRBS

% TODO
%    The maximum length L indicates the periodicity of the sequence.
%    To identify the static gain of the process, the duration of at least one pulse must be greater than the rise time tm of the process:
%    The value of N is determined then respecting the condition tm <N.Te.
%    The amplitude of the PRBS must be small to ensure that the system stays around its operating point. But, it is higher than the noise level.
